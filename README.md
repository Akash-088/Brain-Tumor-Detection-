# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based brain tumor classifier that detects and categorizes brain tumors from MRI scans into four categories:
- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

The model is trained using the PyTorch deep learning framework and visualized in Google Colab.
